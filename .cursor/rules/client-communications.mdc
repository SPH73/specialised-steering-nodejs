# Client Communication Files

## Rule: Never Commit Client Communications

**All client-facing communication markdown files must be stored in the `MD/` folder**, which is git-ignored.

## What Goes in MD/ Folder:

- ✅ Email drafts to clients
- ✅ Client meeting notes
- ✅ Proposal documents
- ✅ Explanation documents for non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ Project planning notes for client review
- ✅ Client feedback summaries

## What Gets Committed to Git:

- ✅ Technical documentation (`docs/` folder)
- ✅ API documentation
- ✅ Setup guides
- ✅ Architecture decisions
- ✅ README files
- ✅ Developer-focused documentation

## Examples:

```markdown
❌ BAD - Committed to Git:
/docs/EMAIL-TO-DEVON.md
/docs/CLIENT-AB-TEST-OPTIONS.md
/PROPOSAL-FOR-CLIENT.md

✅ GOOD - Stored in MD/ (ignored):
/MD/EMAIL-TO-DEVON.md
/MD/CLIENT-AB-TEST-OPTIONS.md
/MD/PROPOSAL-FOR-CLIENT.md
```

## Why This Matters:

1. **Clean Repository:** Code docs separate from client communications
2. **Context Clarity:** Developers vs client-facing documents are distinct
3. **Temporary Nature:** Client communications are often outdated after decisions made
4. **Professional Boundary:** Internal git history doesn't need client negotiations

## Current .gitignore Configuration:

```
MD/              ← All files in this folder are git-ignored
*-todo.md        ← Any -todo.md files ignored
```

## Checking Before Commit:

Before committing markdown files, ask:
- **Is this for developers or clients?**
  - Developers → `docs/` or root
  - Clients → `MD/`
  
- **Is this temporary or permanent?**
  - Temporary → `MD/`
  - Permanent → commit to git

- **Does this explain code or explain decisions to stakeholders?**
  - Code → commit to git
  - Stakeholders → `MD/`

## If You Accidentally Commit:

```bash
# Remove from git but keep local file
git rm --cached path/to/client-doc.md

# Move to correct location
mv path/to/client-doc.md MD/

# Commit the removal
git commit -m "Move client communication to MD/ folder (git-ignored)"
```
