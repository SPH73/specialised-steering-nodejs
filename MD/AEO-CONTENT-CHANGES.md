## Quick Summary

**What's happening:** I've created AEO-optimized copy for your website, focusing on location (Germiston), specific services (pumps, motors, orbitrols), and action-oriented language.

**Where to see it:** All changes are live on **staging** (not production) for you to review.

**What I need:** Your feedback on whether you want:
- **Option 1:** Meta descriptions only (safest - Google sees changes, visitors don't)
