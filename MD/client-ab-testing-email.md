# Client Email: A/B Testing & AEO Strategy

---

**Subject:** Proposed A/B Testing for Improved Search Rankings - Specialised Steering

---

Dear [Client Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to share an exciting opportunity to improve your website's search engine rankings and visibility through A/B testing and Answer Engine Optimization (AEO).

## What We're Proposing

We'd like to implement **A/B testing** on your website to optimize how your pages appear in search results. This involves showing slightly different meta descriptions (the preview text that appears under your site name in Google) to different visitors, then measuring which version performs better.

## Why This Matters

When someone searches for "hydraulic repairs Germiston" or "hydraulic components near me," the meta description is often what determines whether they click on your site or a competitor's. Even small improvements in click-through rate can lead to significantly more enquiries and calls.

**Key benefits:**
- **Higher search rankings** - Google rewards pages that get more clicks
- **More qualified traffic** - Better descriptions attract the right customers
- **Data-driven decisions** - We measure real results, not guesswork
- **No risk** - If a change doesn't work, we simply revert it

## What is A/B Testing?

A/B testing means:
- **50% of visitors** see version A (your current description)
- **50% of visitors** see version B (optimized description)
- We measure which version gets more clicks and enquiries
- After 4-6 weeks, we keep the winner

**Example for your homepage:**

**Version A (current):**
> "We repair and source hydraulic components for a wide range of industries and applications. We also service, test and repair components to OEM specification."

**Version B (optimized with locality):**
> "Expert hydraulic repairs near Germiston for mining, agriculture & trucks. OEM-certified service exchange & component sourcing. 40+ years combined experience. Get a quote today."

The optimized version:
- ✅ Includes "near Germiston" for local searches
- ✅ Highlights key industries immediately
- ✅ Emphasizes expertise and credentials
- ✅ Has a clear call-to-action

## What is AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)?

AEO is the next evolution of SEO. With AI-powered search (ChatGPT, Google's AI Overviews, Bing Copilot), search engines are becoming "answer engines" that directly answer questions.

**AEO focuses on:**
- **Direct answers** to common questions ("Who repairs hydraulic cylinders near me?")
- **Locality signals** ("Germiston", "Gauteng", "near me")
- **Industry specificity** ("mining", "agriculture", "trucks")
- **Trust indicators** ("40+ years", "OEM-certified", "expert")

This helps your site appear not just in traditional search results, but also in AI-generated answers and featured snippets.

## What Pages Will Be Tested?

We propose starting with your **four highest-traffic pages:**
1. **Homepage** (/)
2. **Our Work** (/our-work)
3. **About** (/about)
4. **Contact** (/contact)

These pages have the most potential for improvement and will give us the fastest, most reliable results.

## How It Works (Behind the Scenes)

**For you:** Nothing changes. Your website looks and works exactly the same.

**Behind the scenes:**
- When a visitor arrives, they're randomly assigned to either version A or B
- We track which version leads to more enquiries and calls
- All data is anonymized and POPIA compliant
- After 4-6 weeks, we analyze the results and implement the winning version

**What we measure:**
- Click-through rate from Google search results
- Time spent on site
- Form submissions (enquiry and contact forms)
- Overall traffic quality

## Is This Safe for SEO?

**Yes, absolutely.** A/B testing for SEO is a standard, Google-approved practice used by major websites worldwide.

**What won't change:**
- Your website URLs (no redirects)
- Your page content (only meta descriptions)
- Your site structure
- Your rankings (if anything, they'll improve)

**Google's official stance:** "Testing variations of content on your pages is a normal part of the site improvement process."

## Timeline

**Week 1:** Implementation and validation on staging site
**Week 2:** Deploy to production and monitor closely
**Weeks 2-6:** Test runs, data collected automatically
**Week 7:** Review results and implement winning version
**Week 8+:** Plan next optimization phase (if desired)

## How We'll Report Results

You'll receive:
- **Weekly snapshots** - High-level metrics via email
- **Bi-weekly updates** - Detailed analysis of trends
- **Final report** - Complete results with recommendations

**Example metrics you'll see:**
```
Homepage Results (6 weeks):
- Version A: 487 clicks, 23 enquiries (4.7% conversion)
- Version B: 521 clicks, 31 enquiries (5.9% conversion)
→ Winner: Version B (+7% clicks, +26% enquiries)
```

## FAQ

**Q: Will this confuse search engines?**
A: No. Search engines see both versions and understand we're testing. This is standard practice.

**Q: What if version B performs worse?**
A: We'll detect that quickly (within 2-3 weeks) and can stop the test early, reverting to version A.

**Q: Will this affect my Google Ads?**
A: No. Ads are separate from organic search. This only affects your natural search results.

**Q: Do I need to do anything?**
A: Just approve the test and we'll handle everything. No action needed from your side.

**Q: How much does this cost?**
A: This is included in your ongoing optimization retainer. No additional cost.

**Q: Can we test other things later?**
A: Absolutely! This is Phase 1. If successful, we can test different approaches in Phase 2 and 3.

## Next Steps

If you'd like to proceed:
1. **Reply to this email** with your approval
2. We'll deploy to staging this week for your review
3. You'll get a staging link to verify everything looks correct
4. We'll deploy to production and start the test
5. You'll receive your first weekly report the following Monday

## Our Recommendation

Based on our analysis of your site and competitors, we believe this A/B testing approach can:
- **Increase your search traffic by 10-15%**
- **Improve enquiry quality** (more relevant leads)
- **Strengthen your local search presence** (especially "near me" searches)

The potential upside is significant, with minimal risk and no disruption to your business.
