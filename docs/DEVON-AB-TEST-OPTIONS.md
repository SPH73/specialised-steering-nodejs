## Quick Context

The accessibility improvements and form enhancements we discussed are complete and ready to go live. Those are solid. ✅

**This document is about:** Choosing how we test and optimize your website copy for better conversions.

## What's on Staging vs Production Right Now

### **Production (Live Site):**
- Your current approved copy
- Working perfectly
- Zero changes

### **Staging Site:**
- All accessibility improvements
- **Plus** AEO-optimized page content (new copy throughout)
- Ready for you to review

**Staging link:** https://staging.specialisedsteering.com

## Two Testing Options to Choose From

I'm presenting two approaches - you pick which you're comfortable with:

---

## 📊 Option 1: Meta Description Test ONLY (Conservative)

### What This Tests:
**ONLY** the hidden meta descriptions (what shows in Google search results)

**Visible Page Content:** Keep your original wording - zero changes

### What Visitors See:
- **Everything looks identical** to current site
- Hero: "We do Hydraulics Best" (your copy)
- All sections: Your current wording unchanged
- **Only Google sees different descriptions** in search results

### A/B Test:
- **Variant A:** "We repair and source hydraulic components..." (current)
- **Variant B:** "Expert hydraulic repairs near Germiston..." (location-focused)
- 50/50 split testing **meta descriptions only**

### What We Measure:
- Which description gets more clicks **from Google search**
- Which description leads to more form submissions
- Google Search Console click-through rates

### Pros:
✅ Minimal change - safest option  
✅ Your brand voice stays exactly as-is  
✅ Clean test - one variable only  
✅ Easy to understand results  
✅ No content approval needed from you  

### Cons:
⚠️ Doesn't test improvements to page content itself  
⚠️ Slower optimization (meta descriptions only)  

### Timeline:
- Deploy: This week
- Test duration: 4 weeks
- Review results, implement winner

---

## 🚀 Option 2: Full AEO Content Test (Staged Version)

### What This Tests:
**Everything** - meta descriptions AND visible page content

**Visible Page Content:** AEO-optimized copy (what's on staging now)

### What Visitors See:

**Changes Throughout Site:**

**Homepage Hero:**
```
Current: "We do Hydraulics Best"
         "your first choice for hydraulic Repairs"

Staged:  "Hydraulic Component Repairs & Service Exchange"
         "Germiston, Gauteng hydraulic repairs for mining, 
          agriculture & automotive equipment"
```

**Service Descriptions:**
- More specific (lists actual components)
- Location emphasis (Germiston, Gauteng)
- Action-oriented ("repair and source" vs "procure")

**Repair Process:**
```
Current: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3 format

Staged:  Paragraph format with practical details
         (drop-off info, courier acceptance, etc.)
```

**See full comparison:** `AEO-CONTENT-CHANGES.md`

### A/B Test:
We could test:
1. **Option 2A:** All visitors see new AEO content (no A/B test, full implementation)
2. **Option 2B:** A/B test content versions too (50% see new, 50% see original)

### What We Measure:
- Form submission rates
- Time on site
- Bounce rates
- Google click-through rates

### Pros:
✅ Comprehensive optimization  
✅ SEO-optimized language throughout  
✅ More specific, action-oriented copy  
✅ Faster path to maximum improvement  

### Cons:
⚠️ Significant copy changes - bigger change  
⚠️ More variables = harder to isolate what works  
⚠️ Requires your approval of new wording  

### Timeline:
- Review staging: Now
- Get your approval: This week
- Deploy: After approval
- Test/Monitor: 4-6 weeks

## 🎯 My Recommendation for You

**Start with Option 1 (Meta-Only)**, here's why:

### Strategic Approach:
1. **Now:** Test meta descriptions (low-risk, quick)
2. **Get results:** See which SEO approach works (4 weeks)
3. **Phase 2:** Present content changes separately
4. **Choose then:** Implement all, some, or none

### Benefits:
- ✅ **Less risk:** Minimal change
- ✅ **Learn first:** See if "near me" strategy works
- ✅ **Informed decisions:** Meta results guide content decisions
- ✅ **Your pace:** Change gradually, not all at once
