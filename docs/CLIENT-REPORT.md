## What We've Built

### 1. A/B Testing System

**What It Does:**
When someone visits your website, they're randomly shown one of two versions of your page description (the text that appears in Google search results). We track which version leads to more enquiries, then keep the winner.

**How It Works:**
- 50% of visitors see Version A (your current descriptions)
- 50% of visitors see Version B (optimized descriptions)
- After 4-6 weeks, we analyze the results
- We implement the winning version for everyone

**What's Being Tested:**
- **Homepage** - Your main landing page
- **Our Work** - Your portfolio page
- **About** - Your company information page
- **Contact** - Your contact page

**No Changes to Your Website:**
Your website looks and works exactly the same. Only the preview text in Google search results is being tested.

## What's Changed (Technical)

### Version A (Current - Control)

**Homepage Description:**
> "We repair and source hydraulic components for a wide range of industries and applications. We also service, test and repair components to OEM specification. View our range and examples of client work."

### Version B (Optimized - Test)

**Homepage Description:**
> "Expert hydraulic repairs near Germiston for mining, agriculture & trucks. OEM-certified service exchange & component sourcing. 40+ years combined experience. Get a quote today."

**What Makes Version B Better:**
- ✅ **"near Germiston"** - Captures local searches like "hydraulic repairs near me"
- ✅ **Specific industries** - "mining, agriculture & trucks" immediately tells visitors you serve their industry
- ✅ **Proof of expertise** - "40+ years combined experience" builds trust
- ✅ **OEM-certified** - Shows quality and credibility
- ✅ **Clear call-to-action** - "Get a quote today" tells visitors what to do next

**Similar optimizations** have been applied to your Our Work, About, and Contact pages.

## Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)

### What Is AEO?

AEO is the next evolution of SEO. With AI-powered search (ChatGPT, Google's AI Overviews, Bing Copilot), search engines are becoming "answer engines" that directly answer questions.

**Example:**
- **Old search:** User types "hydraulic repairs" → sees list of websites
- **New search:** User asks "Who repairs hydraulic cylinders near me?" → sees direct answer with your business highlighted

**How We've Optimized for AEO:**
1. **Locality signals** - "Germiston", "Gauteng", "near me"
2. **Direct answers** - Answer implied questions clearly
3. **Industry specificity** - "mining", "agriculture", "trucks"
4. **Trust indicators** - "40+ years", "OEM-certified", "expert"
5. **Action-oriented** - Clear next steps for visitors

## Investment & ROI

### Implementation Cost
- **Included in your ongoing optimization retainer**
- No additional cost for A/B testing system

### Expected Return on Investment

**Conservative Estimate:**
- +5% CTR improvement = +20 additional site visits/month

- Average project value: R50,000
- **ROI: R50,000/month potential increase**

**Realistic Estimate:**
- +10-15% CTR improvement = +40-60 additional visits/month
