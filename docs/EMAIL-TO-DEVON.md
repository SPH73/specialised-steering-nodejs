# Email to Devon - A/B Testing Explanation

**Subject:** A/B Testing Now Live - How It Works

---

Hi Devon,

I wanted to explain the A/B testing we've set up on the Specialised Steering website and how it works.

## What We're Testing

We're running a test to see which website copy performs better:
- **Version A:** My recommended "near me" phrasing (e.g., "hydraulic repairs near me in Germiston")
- **Version B:** Your preferred original wording

The test is running on the homepage, about page, contact page, and our-work page.

## How It Works (Simple Version)

**Think of it like flipping a coin:**

1. **New visitor arrives** → System flips a coin (50/50 chance)
2. **Heads = Version A**, Tails = Version B
3. **Cookie saved on their device** → They always see the same version when they return
4. **Lasts 90 days** → Consistent experience for each visitor

**Why the same version each time?**
- Prevents confusion (imagine seeing different content each visit!)
- Gives valid test results
- Industry best practice

## Random Assignment Example

When I tested in incognito mode twice and got Version B both times, that's just random chance:
- **First test:** 50% chance → Got B
- **Second test:** 50% chance → Got B again
- **Probability:** 25% (like getting tails twice in a row)

If I tested 10 times, I'd probably see:
- Version A: 5 times
- Version B: 5 times
- *(or something close to 50/50)*

## What We're Measuring

After 2-4 weeks (and minimum 100 form submissions), we'll know:
- Which version gets **more contact form submissions**
- Which version gets **more parts enquiries**
- Which version has **better click-through rate from Google**

## Example Result

```
Version A (Near-me copy):    45 form submissions from 1,250 visitors = 3.6%
Version B (Your copy):       38 form submissions from 1,250 visitors = 3.0%

Result: Version A wins by 20% ✅
Recommendation: Keep Version A permanently
```

## Privacy & Compliance

✅ **Cookie disclosed** in cookie policy  
✅ **No personal data** stored (just "A" or "B")  
✅ **POPIA compliant**  
✅ **Users can delete** via browser settings  

## Timeline

- **Now:** Test running live (50% of visitors see each version)
- **Week 1-2:** Collecting data
- **Week 3-4:** Analyzing results  
- **After test:** Implement winning version permanently

I'll send you weekly updates on how it's performing.

## Questions?

**Q: Can I see both versions?**  
A: Yes! I can send screenshots, or you can clear cookies between tests.

**Q: Will this hurt our Google ranking?**  
A: No - Google supports A/B testing and both versions are high-quality content.

**Q: What if it's a tie?**  
A: We keep your preferred version (Version B) and save time on further optimization.
