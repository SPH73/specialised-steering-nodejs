        <h3>7.1 Google Photos Picker API</h3>
        <p>
          Our website uses the Google Photos Picker API to allow administrators
          to select photos from their Google Photos library for display in our
          public business gallery. This section explains how we use this API and
          handle Google user data.
        </p>

        <h4>What Google Data We Access</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>API Scope:</strong> We use the readonly Google Photos Picker
            scope
            (<code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/photospicker.mediaitems.readonly</code>)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Accessed:</strong> Only photos that are explicitly
            selected by our administrators through the Google Photos Picker
            interface
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Access Level:</strong> Read-only access to selected photos
            only
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No Broad Access:</strong> We cannot access your entire
            Google Photos library, only the specific photos you select
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No Modification:</strong> We cannot modify, delete, or
            organize photos in your Google Photos library
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No Additional Data:</strong> We do not access photo albums,
            favorites, location data, or other library features
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>How We Use Google Photos Data</h4>
        <p>
          We use the Google Photos Picker API exclusively for the following
          purpose:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>An administrator logs into our secure admin panel</li>
          <li>The administrator clicks "Update Gallery from Google Photos"</li>
          <li>
            The Google Photos Picker opens, showing the administrator's Google
            Photos
          </li>
          <li>
            The administrator selects specific photos showcasing completed
            hydraulic steering repairs
          </li>
          <li>Selected photos are downloaded once from Google Photos</li>
          <li>
            Photos are uploaded to Cloudinary (our image hosting service) for
            optimization and delivery
          </li>
          <li>
            Photos are displayed publicly in our gallery at
            <a href="/gallery">specialisedsteering.com/gallery</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            The gallery showcases our completed repair work to potential
            customers
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>Purpose:</strong> This integration allows us to efficiently
          manage our business photo gallery by selecting photos from Google
          Photos, which are then used solely to showcase our hydraulic steering
          repair services to potential customers.
        </p>
